# Governance

This is a base implementation of governance contract for Harbor Protocol . The contract can be extended to be used by other protocol with relatively same proposal execution behaviour.

The contract uses the binding from package/bindings in the root directory to interact with Aether Native Modules for Queries and Messages.
